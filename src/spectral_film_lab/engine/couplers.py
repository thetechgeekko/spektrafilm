    Apply coupler inhibitors to the raw data based on density curves and inhibitor values.
    Coupler inhibitors are released when density is formed in the emulsion layers.
    If a layer is dense, the inhibitors are released to prevent further density formation in neighboring layers.
    Also self-inhibitors in the same layer, after spatial diffusion, can prevent further density formation
    in nearby areas, adding a local contrast effect.

    Parameters:
    raw (numpy.ndarray): The raw data to which inhibitors will be applied.
    density_cmy (numpy.ndarray): The density values for each layer.
    density_max (float): The maximum density value achievable for each layer, used for normalization.
    dir_couplers_matrix (numpy.ndarray): The inhibitors matrix. Fisrt index is the input layer, second index is the output layer.
    diffusion_size_pixel (int): The size of the gaussian filter for the diffusion of the inhibitors in xy.
    high_exposure_couplers_shift (float): if overexposure increases saturation, this will increase the inhibitors effect at higher density
