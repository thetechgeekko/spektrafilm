    Apply coupler inhibitors to the raw data based on density curves and inhibitor values.
    Coupler inhibitors are released when density is formed in the emulsion layers.
    If a layer is dense, the inhibitors are released to prevent further density formation in neighboring layers.
    Also self-inhibitors in the same layer, after spatial diffusion, can prevent further density formation
    in nearby areas, adding a local contrast effect.
